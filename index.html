    I have not discussed the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code 
    in my program with anyone other than my instructor or the teaching 
    assistants assigned to this course.

    I have not used HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code obtained 
    from another student, or any other unauthorized source, either 
    modified or unmodified.

    If any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code or documentation 
    used in my program was obtained from another source, such as a 
    textbook or website, that has been clearly noted with a proper 
    citation in the comments of my program.
